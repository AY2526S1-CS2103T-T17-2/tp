### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

Step 1.





## Import/export feature

The current import/export mechanism allows users to save and load contacts from CSV files. This is facilitated by the `CsvUtil` class, which handles serialization and deserialization between the AddressBook and .csv files.

The feature introduces two new commands:

* `ImportCommand`: Imports person data from a specified CSV file into the AddressBook.

* `ExportCommand`: Exports the current AddressBook data into a specified CSV file.

Internally, the ImportCommand and ExportCommand interact with the Model component through the following operations:

* `ImportCommand#execute(Path filePath)` Reads and merges contact data from the given CSV file into the current AddressBook.

* `ExportCommand#execute()` Writes the current AddressBook data into the default destination.

The import/export logic is encapsulated within CsvUtil, which defines:

* `CsvUtil#readContactsFromCsv(Path csvPath)` â€” Parses the CSV file into a list of Person objects.

* `CsvUtil#writeContactsToCsv(Path csvPath, List<Person> contacts)` â€” Converts the contact's data into a CSV representation and writes it to the file.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the import/export mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `import myData.csv` command to import their contacts from the `myData` file into the address book. This will add on the imported contacts into their already existing ones.

The following sequence diagram shows how an import operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/ImportSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="ImportSequenceDiagram-Logic" />


Step 2. The user executes `export` command to export every contact in the address book.

The following sequence diagram shows how an export operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/ExportSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="ExportSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an `import` command

<puml src="diagrams/ImportActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Favorite/Unfavorite feature

The favorite/unfavorite feature allows users to mark contacts as favorites and sort them to the top of the contact list. This is implemented through the `FavCommand` and `UnfavCommand` classes.

The feature introduces two new commands:

* `FavCommand`: Marks a person as favorite based on their index in the displayed list.
* `UnfavCommand`: Removes the favorite status from a person based on their index in the displayed list.

The favorite status is stored as part of the `Person` object through a `Favorite` field, which is:
* Persisted in the JSON storage file (`JsonAdaptedPerson`)
* Used for sorting the contact list (favorites appear first)
* Displayed in the UI with a star icon (â˜…)

Key components involved:

* `FavCommand#execute(Model model)` â€” Marks the person at the specified index as favorite
* `UnfavCommand#execute(Model model)` â€” Removes the favorite status from the person at the specified index
* `ModelManager#setPerson(Person target, Person editedPerson)` â€” Updates the person in the address book
* `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate predicate)` â€” Refreshes the displayed list
* `ModelManager#sortPersons()` â€” Sorts persons with favorites at the top
* `JsonAdaptedPerson` â€” Serializes/deserializes the `favorite` field

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the favorite/unfavorite mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user views their contact list and wants to mark contact #1 as a favorite.

Step 2. The user executes `fav 1` command. The `FavCommand` retrieves the person at index 1 from the filtered list.

Step 3. A new `Person` object is created with the same details but with `favorite` set to `true`.

Step 4. The `Model` updates the person in the address book and triggers a re-sort, moving favorites to the top.

Step 5. The UI refreshes to show the updated list with the favorited contact at the top, marked with a star (â˜…).

Step 6. The changes are automatically saved to the JSON storage file.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to store favorite status:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store as a field in the `Person` class.
  * Pros: Simple to implement, easy to persist, integrates naturally with existing edit operations.
  * Cons: Adds another field to every person object.

* **Alternative 2:** Maintain a separate list of favorite person IDs.
  * Pros: Potentially more memory efficient if few contacts are favorited.
  * Cons: More complex to maintain consistency, harder to persist, requires additional data structure.

**Aspect: How to sort favorites:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Automatic sorting in `ModelManager` when list is updated.
  * Pros: Ensures favorites are always at the top, consistent user experience.
  * Cons: Performance impact on every list update.

* **Alternative 2:** Manual sorting only when user requests.
  * Pros: Better performance for large contact lists.
  * Cons: Inconsistent display, user needs to remember to sort.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Command History feature

The command history feature allows users to navigate through previously entered commands using arrow keys. The history is persisted across application sessions.

The command history mechanism is facilitated by the `CommandHistory` class, which stores up to 10 recent commands and provides navigation capabilities.

Key components involved:

* `CommandHistory#addCommand(String command)` â€” Adds a new command to the history
* `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommand()` â€” Retrieves the previous command in the history
* `CommandHistory#getNextCommand()` â€” Retrieves the next command in the history
* `CommandBox#handleUpArrow()` â€” Navigates to the previous command
* `CommandBox#handleDownArrow()` â€” Navigates to the next command
* `CommandHistoryStorage` â€” Interface for reading/writing command history
* `JsonCommandHistoryStorage` â€” JSON-based implementation of command history storage
* `JsonSerializableCommandHistory` â€” JSON-friendly wrapper for command history data

The implementation has the following key features:

* **Limited Size:** The history stores a maximum of 10 commands. When this limit is reached, the oldest command is removed (FIFO queue).
* **Smart Filtering:** Empty or whitespace-only commands are not added to history. Consecutive duplicate commands are not added (non-consecutive duplicates are allowed).
* **Persistence:** The command history is saved to `commandhistory.json` and loaded on application startup.
* **Navigation State:** The `CommandHistory` maintains a `currentPosition` pointer for navigation. Up arrow moves backward through history (decrements position), down arrow moves forward through history (increments position), and at the end of history, the original input is restored.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command history mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. `LogicManager` loads the command history from `commandhistory.json`.

Step 2. The user executes several commands: `list`, `find Alice`, `fav 1`.

Step 3. Each successful command is added to the `CommandHistory` via `CommandHistory#addCommand()`.

Step 4. The user starts typing a new command but wants to reference a previous one.

Step 5. The user presses the â†‘ (up arrow) key. `CommandBox#handleUpArrow()` is triggered, which:
   * Saves the current input as temporary input
   * Calls `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommand()`
   * Displays the previous command (`fav 1`)

Step 6. The user presses â†‘ again to see `find Alice`, then â†‘ again to see `list`.

Step 7. The user presses â†“ (down arrow) to navigate forward through the history.

Step 8. When reaching the end of the history, the command box restores the original input that was saved in Step 5.

Step 9. When the user exits the application, the command history is saved to `commandhistory.json` via `Storage#saveCommandHistory()`.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: History size limit:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Fixed limit of 10 commands.
  * Pros: Bounded memory usage, predictable behavior, sufficient for most use cases.
  * Cons: Very active users may want more history.

* **Alternative 2:** Unlimited history per session, cleared on exit.
  * Pros: No arbitrary limit during session.
  * Cons: Potential memory issues with very long sessions, loses history on restart.

**Aspect: History persistence:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Persist history across sessions.
  * Pros: Convenient for users, maintains context across work sessions.
  * Cons: Requires additional storage file, slightly more complex implementation.

* **Alternative 2:** Clear history on application exit.
  * Pros: Simpler implementation, no storage needed, privacy benefit.
  * Cons: Users lose convenient access to previous commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Command Autocomplete feature

The command autocomplete feature allows users to quickly complete commands and file paths by pressing the TAB key. This improves typing efficiency and reduces errors.

The autocomplete mechanism is facilitated by the `CommandBox` UI component, which intercepts TAB key presses and provides suggestions based on the current input.

Key components involved:

* `CommandBox#handleTab()` â€” Handles TAB key press and performs autocompletion
* `CommandBox#getCommandSuggestions(String input)` â€” Returns list of matching commands
* `CommandBox#getFileSuggestions(String input)` â€” Returns list of matching files (for `import` command)
* `LogicManager.ALL_COMMANDS` â€” Static array containing all available command words for autocompletion

The implementation supports the following:

* **Command Word Completion:** When the user types part of a command word and presses TAB, if there's a single match, it completes the command word automatically. If there are multiple matches, it shows a list of possible completions.
* **File Path Completion:** For the `import` command specifically, it detects CSV files in the user's Downloads folder and suggests matching file names based on the current input, supporting both absolute paths and filenames.
* **Smart Matching:** The autocomplete uses prefix matching to find relevant suggestions.

Given below are example usage scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Command Completion**

Step 1. The user types `fi` in the command box.

Step 2. The user presses TAB. `CommandBox#handleTab()` is triggered.

Step 3. The system searches `ALL_COMMANDS` for commands starting with "fi".

Step 4. Since only `find` matches, it automatically completes to `find `.

**Scenario 2: Multiple Matches**

Step 1. The user types `a` in the command box.

Step 2. The user presses TAB.

Step 3. Multiple commands match (`add`, `alias`).

Step 4. The system displays a list of matching commands in the result display.

**Scenario 3: File Path Completion**

Step 1. The user types `import cont` in the command box.

Step 2. The user presses TAB.

Step 3. The system detects this is an `import` command and searches the Downloads folder for CSV files starting with "cont".

Step 4. If `contacts.csv` is found, it completes to `import contacts.csv`.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Scope of autocomplete:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Autocomplete commands and import file paths only.
  * Pros: Focused on high-value use cases, simpler implementation.
  * Cons: Could be extended to other parameters.

* **Alternative 2:** Autocomplete all command parameters.
  * Pros: More comprehensive assistance.
  * Cons: Complex to implement, may be intrusive for experienced users.

**Aspect: File path search location:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Search only in Downloads folder.
  * Pros: Matches common user behavior, reduces search scope.
  * Cons: May not work if files are stored elsewhere.

* **Alternative 2:** Search entire file system.
  * Pros: More flexible, finds files anywhere.
  * Cons: Performance issues, security concerns, overwhelming number of matches.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
